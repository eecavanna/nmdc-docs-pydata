# FAIR data

### Making microbiome data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).

The NMDC is committed to adhering to [FAIR Guiding Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) with regard to data management best practices. We have previously worked to develop the [FAIR Microbiome Implementation Network](https://www.go-fair.org/implementation-networks/overview/fair-microbiome/) (IN) to align and synergize our efforts with that of the [GO FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/) community. Through the FAIR Microbiome IN, we were able to connect with the international microbiome standards community to advance our collective mission. We are also registered with [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/biodbcore-001563/), which provides journals with a curated source of recommended repositories.

Our latest efforts include:

1. Developing the NMDC FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) which outlines our technology choices for implementing each of the FAIR Guiding Principles. Check out the NMDC [FIP](https://fip-wizard.ds-wizard.org/wizard/projects/531496b9-4f8d-4d20-88be-fa5595056508)!

2. Working with the broader research community to develop reporting guidelines for environmental microbiomes. The Standards for Technical Reporting in Environmental and host-Associated Microbiome Studies ([STREAMS](https://streamsmicrobiome.org/)) guidelines are being written based on the ([STORMS](https://www.stormsmicrobiome.org/)) reporting checklist. The STREAMS guidelines will provide standardized checklists to assist environmental, non-human host, and synthetic microbiome researchers with writing manuscripts and data management plans. Keep an eye out for updates this year!
