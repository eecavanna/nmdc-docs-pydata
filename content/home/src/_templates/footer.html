{#
    Note: `{{ super() }}` renders the block's original content (i.e. the content defined in
          https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/blob/master/sphinx_rtd_theme/footer.html#L60).
          As of the time of this writing, there is no content there; but that could change over time.
